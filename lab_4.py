This program allows a user three tries to guess the correct answer to the question
question = "what is capital of california". The answer is "Sacramento".

We first set max_tries = 3. Then we create a loop to iterate three times. for each iteration,
we ask the user for the answer (user input). Then based on the answer the user gies, we check 
to see if the user input matches the answer. If so , print "Correct!", then terminate the loop with a 
break statement.

If the user could not guess the correct answer withing the max_tries then print
"you hae used up your allotment of guesses" then print "The correct answer is 'California'".
